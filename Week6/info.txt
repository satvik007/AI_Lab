For DFS
    Use a LIFO queue, put in tuple of (depth, state)
    Allow dfs to run till a max_depth and the successively increase max_depth
    (Its not necessary like last week's program because search space is very small.)
    Use a parent to keep track of the path.

For BFS
    Just use a normal queue
    Use a parent to keep track of the path.

For AStar
    Use a priority queue, put in a tuple of (g + h, g, state)
    heuristic - h(x) = abs(x - gx) + abs(y - gy)
    Use a parent to keep track of the path.
    Use dist instead of parent to keep track of visited nodes.
