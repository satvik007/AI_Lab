The program is a simple a Star search with a complex heuristic.

The heuristic is designed in such a way that probably a human might think. It gives a very large priority for the upper 
line completely done or the left line completely done and so on.
For n = 3, the heuristic is mostly similar to manhattan one, but with the difference that there is a very large penalty for
1 being far from its location.

Then in the loop where we pop elements out of the priority queue, 
there are 2 blocks 
1st one considers one of the empty spaces being moved in each of the 4 directions.
2nd block considers the other space being moved in each of the 4 directions.
