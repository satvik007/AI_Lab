For DFS
    Use a LIFO queue, put in tuple of (depth, state_array, zero_location)
    Allow dfs to run till a max_depth and the successively increase max_depth
    Use a parent to keep track of the path.

For BFS
    Just use a normal queue, put in tuple of (depth, state_array, zero_location)
    Use a parent to keep track of the path.

For AStar
    Use a priority queue, put in a tuple of ((g + h, g, _hash_of_string), (state_array, empty_square_location))
    First part of the tuple is for priority, next part is the state
    _hash is necessary in priority because np arrays can't be compared directly but its hash can be.
    (Its not a hash in reality but just converting the np array to a string)
    heuristic - h(x) = abs(x - gx) + abs(y - gy) Manhattan distance.
    Use a parent to keep track of the path.
    Use dist instead of parent to keep track of visited nodes.
