The idea is to index the directions as 3 lists

dx = [-1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
dy = [0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0]
dz = [0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1]

to determine direction we take a random number and then that number determine which of these is added to the current location.
e.g. If the random number is 0 then (0, 0, 0) becomes (-1, 0, 0)
If the random number is 1 then (0, 0, 0) becomes (1, 0, 0)
